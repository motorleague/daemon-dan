TODO list for Daevel daemon template
------------------------------------

- Version info in prog and docs

- make lockfile a configurable item

- improve portability

- static check code

- consider making the configuration data more table-driven. For example,
  store the type of parameters and then use it in the processing.

- better expression parsing in config data, starting with quoted strings

- allow multiple ports to be bound and listened on

- in socket.c, create new gethostbyname that makes allowance for those
  stupid systems which are fussy about the case of the input string, 
  and which sometimes return mixed-case answers (which hopefully won't
  matter.) Eg some versions of HP-UX

- sample client program that connects to the server, maybe. maybe not.

- test suite. So far all we have is the config data tester, badfile.conf.
  (So far not that much of the code lends itself to test rigs, in fact)

- when -t param used on cygwin, process isn't killed 

- be more sensible/careful inside signal handlers

- setup alarm when accepting data to avoid resource depletion through
  accident or malice

- search for "UNFEATURE" throughout and fix (many of them are mentioned 
  in this TODO file)

- better distinguish the 3 outputs: log, debug and client. At the
  moment it is somewhat confused.

- ipv6. Not much code to add, but some thinking required. An example
  of encapsulating practices documented in Exim, Postfix etc.

- better security checks on incoming connections

- socket options (easy. merge the options offered by Samba/Apache.)

- rename init_socket listen_socket in util.*

- remove parameter from init_socket fn - no need to pass structure in
  daemon.c
