Version 1.0, 27 May 2008

This framework was first written in 2003, then presented in a lightening talk
at linux.conf.au 2004 in Adelaide. It went up on shearer.org in 2005, and
finally in 2008 it went up on code.launchpad.net.

In the meantime various people started using it and a few sent in patches. 
Before uploading to launchpad, the following changes were made:

   * moved from GPLv2 to GPLv3, and include COPYING
   * applied various patches (see ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS)
   * cleaned up with astyle (see CODINGSTYLE)
