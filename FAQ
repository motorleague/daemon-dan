FAQ for Daevel
--------------

0. What's the point?

I wanted to write a daemon for a buildfarm project, and in doing so
avoid the most common performance, security and other traps. There is
so much code around that is known to be solid, so I went looking for
an encapsulation of the principles as a starting point. To my
surprise, there was no such thing. This is meant to be a small, simple
and understandable start to writing your own network daemon. In the
process I looked at a lot of code, but rather than write a long list
of findings, I wrote my own code. So for example, rather than complain
about what appears to be unsafe code in fetchmail's lockfile routines,
I wrote my own with snippets of what I learnt from Samba, ssh, Apache
and others. Similarly for TCP socket error handling, where different
programming teams have learnt about different errors across platforms
and a summary of the results are used here.

1. Will it work on my OS?

So far Daevel has been tried on Linux, FreeBSD and other Unix operating
systems. It also compiles on Windows systems running the Cygwin environment
(www.cygwin.org). It will require considerable effort (which is quite 
possible, and planned) to make it compile on native Windows compilers 
without any Unix emulation libraries required.

2. Do I have to know how to program?

Well no, but you have to at least be willing to learn :-) This is of no
use to someone who wants a ready-made package to do something-or-other.
It is for people who are not very keen on reinventing the wheel yet again
and again while writing a Unix-style daemon.
